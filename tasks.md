# Top Coder Challenge: Execution Plan

## Step-by-Step Tasks Checklist

- [ ] **Analyze the Data**
  - [x] Review `public_cases.json` to identify patterns in input/output.
  - [x] Review `PRD.md` for business requirements and known/suspected system behaviors.

  - [x] Implement the calculation logic in `run.sh` (or call a script from it).
  - [ ] Ensure the script takes 3 parameters and outputs a single number.
- [ ] **Test the Solution**
  - [ ] Run `./eval.sh` to test against all public cases.
  - [ ] Analyze feedback and error cases for further refinement.
  - [ ] Iterate on the algorithm to improve accuracy.
- [ ] **Prepare for Submission**
