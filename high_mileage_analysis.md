# High Mileage Patterns and Rules (from INTERVIEWS.md)

## 1. Mileage Rate is Tiered and Non-Linear
- First ~100 miles: Full rate (e.g., $0.58/mile).
- After 100 miles: Rate drops, but not in a simple linear or percentage way. Sometimes described as a curve, possibly even logarithmic.
- High-mileage trips: Still pay well, but not proportionally to the number of miles.

> "Oh, mileage is definitely tiered. First 100 miles or so, you get the full rate—like 58 cents per mile. After that, it drops. But it's not a simple drop. I've tried to map it out in Excel, and it's some kind of curve. High-mileage trips still pay well, just not proportionally."

## 2. Efficiency (Miles per Day) Matters
- 180-220 miles/day: Optimal, triggers a bonus.
- Too high or too low: Penalty applied.
- High mileage with low spending: Usually good, triggers a bonus.
- Low mileage with high spending: Usually bad, triggers a penalty.

> "Efficiency is huge. The system absolutely rewards high miles-per-day ratios. But it's not linear. There's a sweet spot around 180-220 miles per day where the bonuses are maximized. Go too low, penalty. Go too high, the bonuses start dropping off again."

## 3. High Mileage Interacts with Other Factors
- Trip Length: High mileage on short trips is treated differently than on long trips.
- Spending: High mileage with low spending is rewarded; high mileage with high spending may not be.

> "Mileage bonuses/penalties interact with trip length and spending."

## 4. Anecdotal/Edge Observations
- Some employees noticed that for very high mileage (e.g., 800+ miles), the per-mile rate can sometimes be higher than for slightly lower mileage, suggesting possible bonus thresholds or non-linear jumps.
- There may be "distance bonuses" or other hidden factors.

> "Marcus from sales swears that 800-mile trips get better per-mile rates than 600-mile trips, but I've seen evidence that contradicts that. Could be other factors at play."
> — Lisa from Accounting

## 5. Calculation Pathways
- Quick trips with high mileage are treated differently than long trips with low mileage.
- Multiple calculation paths likely exist, depending on the combination of trip length, mileage, and spending.

## Actionable Insights for Tuning
- Tiered/Curved Mileage: Consider making the post-100-mile rate drop off more sharply, or use a curve (e.g., logarithmic or square root) for very high mileage.
- Efficiency Bonus/Penalty: Keep the 180-220 miles/day bonus, but add a penalty for extremely high miles/day (e.g., >300).
- High Mileage + Low Spending: Add or increase a bonus for this combination.
- High Mileage + High Spending: Consider a penalty or remove bonuses in this case.
- Multiple Paths: Consider different formulas for short vs. long trips with high mileage.
